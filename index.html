      There is a debate regarding jump ropes' classification. Is it just a game? Or is it a sport? First, we must consider what really defines a sport. Is it the athletisism required? Co-ordination? Years of practice and dedication? Or perhaps other factors are at play. There is no governing body which has the final say as to what qualifies as a sport, so perhaps we will never get a definative answer.
    </p>
    <p class="introPara">
      A recent <a href = "https://www.forbes.com/sites/leighsteinberg/2018/07/28/what-defines-a-sport/"> Forbes article </a> discussing the emergence of E-sports and their claim to be a sport gives us an understanding of what the key factors which define sport. Competition, athletisism, and skill are mentioned as the key criteria upon which we are to judge. Taking a well-known sport like tennis, for example, we see that it fits all three criteria: tennis players compete against an opponent using both shear althetic prowess and deft skill. On the other hand, while jogging certainly requires althetic edurance and the skill to run with great efficiency, there is no competition, so it is not a sport. However, add competition -- as you see in track and field -- and a sport emerges.

    <p class="introPara">
      So, let us see how jump rope does when judged by these criteria. On the first count -- athletisism -- jump rope certainly requires quickness, agility, co-ordination, and edurance. When compared to basketball or football, many may say that jump rope is just a game, but when compared to sports like golf, or darts, it is clear that jump-rope is certainly athletic enough at least. On the second criterion -- skill -- is where jump-rope shines. Its players display fine control over both the rope and their bodies. Whether it be free-style or speed events, jump rope requires skill and dexterity that can only be acquired from hours of practice. Finally, we consider competition. Yes, jump rope can be played for fun without competition, but it also has a competitive side. The Indian Jump Rope Federation released a <a href="https://jumpropefederationofindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/RULES-BOOK-2018-19.pdf"> rules-book </a> which governs its national championships. It lays out how competitive jump rope is played and explains the rules and scoring. The speed compeitiions have a clear, objective way to score (how many jumps completed in the given time). Surely then, jump rope can be made sufficiently competitve.

    <p class="introPara">
      So what is holding jump rope from being a household sport, a sport watched as reverently as basketball, football, or hockey? Perhaps it is because the criteria above are too loose. Octopus, mission-impossible, and huckle-buckle, just to name a few, all fit the criteria, but none of them are considered sports. Any real sport needs to be popular and interesting enough to be watched by others. Until that happends, jump rope will never step into mainstream sports-culture. However, the <a href = "https://gaisf.sport/">General Association of International Sports Federations</a> recently gave the <a href = "https://ijru.sport/"> International Jump Rope Union </a> "Observer Status," a big vote of confidence in jump rope's ability to gather popularity. Sports, like everything, evolve over time, and while jump rope isn't quite there yet, I am confident that jump rope can become a sport in time. It won't be as big as basketball or soccer, but it certainly can become a sport. I look for jump rope to push into the Olympics in the near future, but until then, jump rope rides the fine line between sport and game, similar to dodgeball and table soccer.
